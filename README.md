# DnDGPT - The AI-First DM Assistant for You and Me...now with MCP! 

Hi nerds, 
We're starting fresh with the SRD 5.2 and turning it into all sorts of AI-ready stuff. 

This project utilizes the D&D 5th Edition System Reference Document (SRD), which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The SRD content is provided by Wizards of the Coast and can be found at: https://www.dndbeyond.com/srd?srsltid=AfmBOorj-vF3ByjLOFxGjRyQ4OuJ0vulRSK7mdSRRBGCevHvPOt2uj8W

Starting with preparing documents for vector storage through document splitting, then working on 
understanding said split documents, then we'll be looking at utilizing MCP for all sorts of nonsense. 

Download the SRD 5.2, clone the Repository and follow along!
